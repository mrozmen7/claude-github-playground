# CLAUDE.md – Company Rules

## Purpose
This repository is a playground to learn and test Claude Code GitHub integration.

## How Claude should work
- Always create a new branch (never push directly to main)
- Use clear commit messages
- Open a Pull Request for every change
- Explain what was changed and why

## Safety rules
- Never expose secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords)
- Ask before deleting or renaming files
- Do not change workflows unless explicitly requested

## Communication style
- Use simple explanations
- Prefer step-by-step lists
- If the task is unclear, ask questions before acting

## Definition of Done
- Task matches the Issue description
- README updated if needed
- GitHub Actions are green
- Pull Request is created
